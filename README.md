This is the 7th semester project as part of the Net-Centric Programming course. It is a very straigtforward and simple Java web-app that uses an Excel database.
The app was created using the netbeans IDE. Please note that this is very primitive and un-optimised. There will be bugs and issues. However, there won't be any maintenance for this particular project.
